        "\n",
        "New York City’s affordable housing crisis is one of the most defining policy challenges of the Adams tenure. As the administration approaches its fourth year, the crisis remains a pivotal issue that will extend into the succeeding Mamdani administration.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "New York City’s affordable housing crisis is not merely a logistical shortage of units; it is a crisis of confidence. The Adams administration faces a dual imperative: the technical challenge of increasing supply and the political challenge of navigating a constituency deeply skeptical of development.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the \"City of Yes\" initiative facing pivotal votes, the administration’s public messaging is a critical tool of governance. This project investigates the research question: To what extent does the Adams administration strategically integrate distinct rhetorical themes, specifically supportive services, affordability, and construction, within its public housing messaging?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "By analyzing 27 official transcripts—ranging from press conferences to bill signings—this project moves beyond surface-level readings to uncover the statistical patterns of the Mayor’s rhetoric. The analysis tests the hypothesis that the administration is attempting to \"re-brand\" development by linguistically fusing it with social services, thereby neutralizing opposition to new construction.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Methodology**\n",
        "\n",
        "To answer this research question, two techniques were applied:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**\n",
        "\n",
        "This method was chosen to identify the administration's distinctive vocabulary. Unlike raw frequency counts, TF-IDF penalizes ubiquitous terms such as 'people' or 'city,' thereby isolating the specific policy lexicon that distinguishes the Mayor's rhetorical signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation):**\n",
        "\n",
        "While TF-IDF isolates individual words, LDA is necessary to detect thematic structures. This probabilistic model assumes that each transcript is a mixture of underlying topics. With K=8 topics (selected via interpretability testing), the model elucidates how the Mayor shifts rhetorical frames across contexts—oscillating between a 'sympathetic' register for shelter announcements and a 'triumphant' register for legislative victories."

        "The most immediate insight derived from the Global TF-IDF analysis is the administration's refusal to bifurcate \"building\" and \"caring.\" In traditional housing rhetoric, \"development\" is often pitted against \"community protection.\" However, the data shows that the Adams administration consistently bridges this divide.\n",
        "\n",
        "Terms like \"supportive\" (0.04 score), \"services\" (0.038), and \"health\" appear in the exact same high-frequency tier as \"construction,\" \"buildings,\" and \"apartments\". This co-occurrence is not accidental; it is a rhetorical strategy. By consistently linking \"housing\" with \"supportive services,\" the administration redefines the product being delivered. They are not simply delivering \"units\", which is a cold, quantitative metric, but \"homes with services.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This framing serves a distinct political purpose: it preemptively counters the critique that pro-development policies leave vulnerable populations behind. When discussing construction, the Mayor frequently juxtaposes it with mental health, implicitly framing physical infrastructure as the prerequisite for social stability."

        "A second pattern in the TF-IDF results is the prominence of governance and labor terminology.\n",
        "\n",
        "Words such as \"union,\" \"governor,\" \"speaker,\" and \"partnership\" rank exceptionally high. In many comparable housing policy corpora, technical terms (zoning, tax, subsidy) dominate. Here, the \"who\" is as important as the \"what.\" Crucially, the 'who' is as significant as the 'what.' The recurrent invocation of 'unions' and 'labor' effectively reframes the housing crisis not merely as a shelter issue, but as an engine for economic mobility.\n",
        "\n",
        "By framing a construction project not as a boon for real estate developers but as a source of \"union jobs\" for working class New Yorkers, the administration creates a moral permission structure for development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, the high frequency of \"governor\" and \"speaker\" signals a \"coalition style\" of leadership. This defuses the risk of sole accountability.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the housing crisis is a shared burden managed by a \"team\" of city and state leaders, the Mayor is positioned as a collaborator rather than the sole target for frustration.\n",
        "\n",
        "This rhetorical \"sharing of the stage\" validates the administration's \"City of Yes\" slogan—implying that saying \"yes\" to housing is saying \"yes\" to a broad political consensus, not just a mayoral decree."

        "\n",
        "By wrapping \"construction\" (the controversial mechanism) in the language of \"supportive services\" (the moral imperative) and \"union jobs\" (the economic benefit), the administration attempts to neutralize opposition to development.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"balance\" asked by the research question is achieved through integration: Rental affordability is rarely discussed as an abstract market dynamic but is grounded in the \"services\" the city provides and the \"partnerships\" with the state that make it possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data reveals an administration attempting to shift the Overton window, transforming \"pro-development\" from a dirty word into a synonym for \"pro-union,\" \"pro-health,\" and \"pro-family.\" This \"Narrative Infrastructure\" is as crucial to the Mayor's housing strategy as the physical buildings themselves."
